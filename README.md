# MitigatingPopularityBiasUserStudy
Pre-processed dataset created from the results of the user study that was conducted for the Master's Thesis by Robin Ungruh with the title: "Mitigating Popularity Bias in Music Recommender Systems: Effects on Fair Exposure, User Perception, and Motivation for Exploration".

The data in this repository was created by extracting and analyzing user profiles based on the top 25 of the participants' Spotify accounts, creating a more extensive user profile by expanding the data with Spotify recommendations. To create recommendations, we applied the collaborative filtering algorithm "RankALS" and the popularity bias mitigation algorithms "FA*IR" and "Calibrated Popularity".
The questionnaire scores are retrieved from the user's responses to questionnaires during the study. For more information, we refer to the Master's Thesis:
