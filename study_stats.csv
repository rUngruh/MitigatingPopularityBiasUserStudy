This is truly a fantastic feature, especially compared to other music recommendation systems that tend to suggest only a limited range of song types.

However, I still have some questions about the system. I wonder if the provided songs are primarily focused on works from a few years ago, with fewer selections from the latest music. If it could combine both new and older songs to create a more comprehensive recommendation playlist, I believe that would be a very promising direction for improvement.",679.396923076923,82.0,325,0.1353846153846153,0.4123076923076923,0.4523076923076923,Diverse,357.72,144.0,-0.4734742124236879,0.0033469798498688,0.12,0.48,0.4,5,155.2,134.0,-0.7715621093820764,0.38478946376169354,0.0,1.0,0.0,50
